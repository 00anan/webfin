				<p class="caption"><a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Pig" target="_blank">Pigs</a> and <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rabbit" target="_blank">rabbits</a> are great resources to have on your Stardew farm. As shown above, pigs can dig out truffles when they are let outside, while rabbits drop items such as wool and <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Rabbit%27s_Foot" target="_blank">rabbit's feet</a> inside their coop. The truffles can be sold or can be made into oil using the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oil_Maker" target="_blank">oil maker</a>, which can either be used for cooking or sold for a better price. Wool can be used to make cloth to make clothes, while the rabbit's foot can be used to gift villagers as a "<a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Friendship#Gifts" target="_blank">Loved gift</a>", meaning that it is a gift you can give villagers to gain the most friendship points. </p>

				<p class="caption">There are eight total <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Farm_Maps" target="_blank">farm layouts</a> available to choose when you start your farm in Stardew Valley. Among these eight are the forest farm layout and the four corners farm layout (four corners image credits to Renee Aguila on <a href="https://www.namehero.com/gaming-blog/the-9-best-stardew-valley-farm-layouts-to-try/" target="_blank">NameHero</a>.) The forest farm provides useful resources, having areas for forage and mahogany trees, which are normally more difficult to collect, at the comfort of their own farm. The four corners farm is an excellent layout for those who wish to co-op with friends, with corners dedicated to different farm layouts, allowing players to smoothly distribute the farm space amongst themselves. The hill-top farm includes a quarry within the farm, saving the player from a long trip from the regular farm to the quarry. This is a great resource to level-up the player's <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Mining" target="_blank">Mining</a> skill, especially in the early game, without interference from monsters. There is a river flowing through this farm as well, allowing for the player to catch freshwater fish at the comfort of their own farm. The meadowlands farm provides special <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Grass#Blue_Grass" target="_blank">blue grass</a> that animals love, helping the player gain friendship with their own animals. When the player begins a game with this farm, instead of receiving the regular 15 parsnip seed, the player is given 15 hay. Like the hill-top farm, the meadowlands farm has a river flowing through the farm as well.</p>

				<p class="caption"><a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Strawberry" target="_blank">Strawberries</a> and <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Blueberry" target="_blank">blueberries</a> are two of the regrowable crops in Stardew Valley, meaning that once you plant and harvest them, they regrow without you having to buy and replant new seeds. In the game, strawberries are <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/" target="_blank">Spring
					Spring</a> crops, while blueberries are <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Summer" target="_blank">Summer</a> crops. They both come out to make around 20.8G a day, thanks to its regrowability. </p>
