				<p class="caption">Pigs and rabbits are great resources to have on your Stardew farm. As shown above, pigs can dig out truffles when they are let outside, while rabbits drop items such as wool and rabbits' feet inside their coop. The truffles can be sold or can be made into oil using the <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oil_Maker" target="_blank">oil maker</a>, which can either be used for cooking or sold for a better price. Wool can be used to make cloth to make clothes, while the rabbit's foot can be used to gift villagers as a "Loved gift". </p>

			<h2>Farm Layout Spotlights - <em>Forest Farm Layout</em>, <em>Four Corners Farm Layout</em></h2>

				</div>	
				<p class="caption">There are eight total farm layouts available to choose when you start your farm in Stardew Valley. Among these eight are the forest farm layout and the four corners farm layout (four corners image credits to Renee Aguila on <a href="https://www.namehero.com/gaming-blog/the-9-best-stardew-valley-farm-layouts-to-try/" target="_blank">NameHero</a>.) The forest farm provides useful resources, having areas for forage and mahogany trees, which are normally more difficult to collect, at the comfort of their own farm. The four corners farm is an excellent layout for those who wish to co-op with friends, with corners dedicated to different farm layouts, allowing players to smoothly distribute the farm space amongst themselves. </p>

			<h2>Crop Spotlights - <em>Strawberries</em>, <em>Blueberries</em></h2>

				</div>	
				<p class="caption">Strawberries and blueberries are two of the regrowable crops in Stardew Valley, meaning that once you plant and harvest them, they regrow without you having to buy new seeds and replant them. In the game, strawberries are Spring crops, while blueberries are Summer crops. They both come out to make around 20.8G a day, thanks to its regrowability. </p>
