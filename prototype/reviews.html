							<p>While the gameplay of Stardew Valley is native to PC, the game supports various platforms across different operating systems, consoles, and mobile devices. Among these platforms is the Steam Deck - Valve Corporation's handheld gaming computer. It only makes sense for Stardew Valley to provide immediate support for the Steam Deck as the device's release succeeds the game's support for controllers.</p>
                            <p>As with all games, there are different ways to enjoy Stardew Valley. Some maximize their efficiency in playing the game to reach time-based or speed-related goals, while others enjoy playing casually at their own pace. Realistically, the Steam Deck is not be the best choice for those focusing on efficiency and speed, as the controls are naturally slower on a joystick when compared to a mouse. </p>
                            <p>One of the noticeable inconveniences during my experience with the Steam Deck was the time it took to access different items on the hotbar of the player's inventory, as the PC version of the game simply requires one key click (the target item's respective number on the hotbar), while the Steam Deck requires the user to maneuver the joystick in the direction of the desired item and wait for the red highlight (the "cursor") to reach it, which takes more time the further rightward the item is on the bar.</p>
                            <p> Even as a more casual player, this turned out to be a bit of a hassle as the player is limited in the amount of time they have each day and the cumulation of the waiting almost felt like a setback to the general progress of the game. As someone with more hours played on PC than on the Steam Deck, these differences are noticeable, however, if someone were to only play the game on the handheld device, these inconveniences would be far less bothersome to the player, as it does not hinder the gameplay too much.</p>
                            <p>Aside from the controller-typical disadvantages, the Steam Deck is an excellent platform to launch the game on. Not only does the handheld nature of the device allow users to play the game in various settings, the Steam Deck easily allows players to download modification packs to enhance the gaming experience, something only the Steam Deck and mobile Android devices offer out of all of the handheld platforms supported by Stardew Valley. </p>
                            <p>A feature of the Steam Deck that would trump the Android devices would be its built-in controllers, allowing users full visibility of the screen, rather than costing visual space for movement control. The Steam Deck also has trackpads built into the system, offering users different options of control, allowing users to choose their method of control according to preference.</p>
                            <p> I personally do prefer the PC gameplay over the Steam Deck as I did not grow up playing console games, making the Steam Deck experience to be something to get used to, and I appreciate the minimization of the unnecessary wasting of in-game time on PC. However, the Steam Deck is an amazing platform to play Stardew Valley, as it has all the advantages of a handheld device without sacrificing the option of modifying the game to improve the gameplay experience. To summarize, the Steam Deck may be a little clunky in terms of control to those not used to console gaming, but it does not outweigh the advantages of the device.</p>

							<p>It is not universal for game developers to allow players to freely develop their own modifications for their game. Some of these modifications, or 'mods', as referred to by players, attempt to improve the utilities of the game, while others make additions or changes to the content of the game itself. This particular mod, as its title suggests, expands the game in various aspects.</p>
                            <p>On its homepage, Nexus Mods, it is described to have 28 new non-player characters, or NPCs, 58 new locations, a whopping 278 character events, and 43 additional fish, not to mention the mods specific to the Stardew Valley Expanded mod. This mod pack available for Stardew Valley greatly expands the game (who would've guessed!), reintroducing excitement for the game for players that are far past the original ending of the game's main story.</p>
                            <p>The mod lets players explore new ground and romance characters that previously were not romanceable before, while introducing new characters that are both romanceable and non-romanceable. In the original game, the player is the only farmer in town, whereas the mod introduces different farmers to the town, allowing for the playable character to experience solidarity with other characters in the game.</p>
                            <p>I particularly liked the character additions, because I was not particularly attached to any of the original characters, and found myself liking some of the new characters more than the original NPCs. The magical aspects of the game are reimagined with more depth, rather than just having the player accept the existence of magic in the game. The mod greatly improves pre-existing aspects of the game by filling in gaps and strengthening the story originally told by the game.</p>
                            <p>While neither of the main story routes a player can choose in Stardew Valley result in any major repercussions, Stardew Valley Expanded adds different complications caused by the player's choices, digging deeper into the main story of the game, leaving no aspect untouched.</p>
                            <p>While all these additions aim to improve the gameplay experience, the sheer volume of content added by this single mod could come across as excessively overwhelming, potentially undermining the simplicity and charm that contributes to the massive popularity of Stardew Valley, possibly even intimidating players from progressing through the game. These additions can easily be unappealing to those who have not finished the game, as the original game offers plenty of aspects to focus on and complete, potentially failing to have early-game players feel the necessity of the mod.</p>
                            <p>The changes or additions made to the original characters may also be unfavorable to some players, as the mod is fanmade, meaning that none of the content newly added by the modification is official to the actual game. The expansion of the map can get exhausting for players, as it increases unnecessary travel time between locations, which honestly gets pretty annoying. Personally, as a supposed "endgame" player, or someone who finished the main story of the game, it is true that there were times where I found myself tired of the repetition of activities, however, as someone who found new achievements and goals to work towards, I have never found the content of the game to be insufficient.</p>
                            <p>I personally enjoyed knowing that I had already finished the "main story" of the game, as it meant that I am free to do whatever I want in terms of "perfecting" the game (for those who don't know, there are different tasks you can complete to reach "perfection" in the original game). The mod did take away some of the familiarity I have gained over the numerous hours I've spent on the game, which could be a good thing to those who are bored, but if you aren't bored with the vanilla (unmodded) game, you might not feel the need to install the mod.</p>
